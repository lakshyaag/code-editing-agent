## 2025-01-03: Implementing Streaming Messages and Token Counting

### Goals
- [ ] Add streaming response support using Gemini API's `GenerateContentStream`
- [ ] Implement token counting functionality
- [ ] Update TUI to handle streaming messages in real-time
- [ ] Maintain compatibility with existing tool execution

### Progress

#### Phase 1: Streaming Messages Implementation âœ…
- **Status**: **COMPLETED**
- **Objective**: Replace the current blocking `GenerateContent` call with `GenerateContentStream`
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Added `ProcessMessageStream` method that uses `GenerateContentStream`
  - Implemented streaming callback mechanism
  - Maintained compatibility with existing tool execution
  - Pre-computed function declarations for better performance

#### Phase 2: Token Counting âœ…
- **Status**: **COMPLETED**
- **Objective**: Add token usage tracking for conversations
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Added `TokenUsage` struct to track input, output, and total tokens
  - Implemented `countTokens` method using Gemini API
  - Integrated token counting into both streaming and non-streaming flows
  - Added `GetTokenUsage` and `ResetTokenUsage` methods for external access

#### Phase 3: TUI Updates for Streaming âœ…
- **Status**: **COMPLETED**  
- **Objective**: Update the UI to render streaming content incrementally
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Added streaming message types (`StreamChunk`, `TokenInfo`)
  - Implemented toggle between streaming and non-streaming modes (F1 key)
  - Added real-time token usage display in status bar
  - Enhanced message rendering to show streaming indicators
  - Added streaming progress indicators in spinner text

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Streaming Support**: Real-time response streaming from Gemini API
2. **Token Tracking**: Comprehensive token usage monitoring and display
3. **Dual Mode Operation**: Toggle between streaming and blocking modes
4. **Tool Compatibility**: Streaming works seamlessly with tool execution
5. **Enhanced UX**: Visual indicators for streaming state and token usage
6. **Performance Optimization**: Pre-computed function declarations

### Latest Update (2025-01-03 13:19:14)
**ðŸš€ MAJOR FIX**: Real-time streaming fully implemented!

**Issue Identified**: Streaming was cutting off and messages were not appearing in real-time as the user expected.

**Root Cause**: The previous implementation accumulated all chunks and only displayed them at the end, which wasn't true streaming.

**Solution Applied - Complete Streaming Rewrite**:
1. **Real-time Architecture**: Implemented channel-based streaming with immediate chunk delivery
2. **Bubble Tea Integration**: Used proper command patterns (`waitForStreamChunk`, `waitForStreamComplete`) 
3. **Live Updates**: Each chunk now appears immediately in the UI as it arrives from the Gemini API
4. **Callback Integration**: Streaming callback sends chunks to UI channels for real-time display
5. **Concurrency**: Proper goroutine management for streaming without blocking the UI

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Channels**: `streamChunkChan` and `streamCompleteChan` for real-time communication
- **Commands**: Bubble Tea commands that listen for streaming chunks and completion
- **Callback**: Agent callback immediately sends chunks to UI via channels
- **Non-blocking**: Channel operations use `select` to avoid blocking the agent

This now provides smooth, real-time streaming like ChatGPT where text appears as it's generated!

### Tool Call Display Fix (2025-01-03 13:24:04)
**ðŸ”§ FIXED**: Tool call display issues resolved!

**Issues Fixed**:
1. **Real-time Tool Calls**: Tool calls now appear immediately during streaming instead of after completion
2. **No More Replacement**: Tool calls stay visible and don't get replaced by subsequent messages  
3. **Better Tool Info**: Collapsed tool calls now show the tool name instead of generic "Tool call"
4. **Complete Details**: Tool calls display both arguments and results when expanded

**Technical Changes**:
- **Agent Level**: Modified streaming to process tool calls immediately as they appear
- **Content Format**: Tool calls now include emoji, tool name, arguments, and result in structured format
- **TUI Rendering**: Enhanced tool message display with better collapsed/expanded states
- **Stream Processing**: Tool calls are processed during streaming, not just at completion

**Tool Call Format Now Shows**:
```
[+] file_reader (collapsed)
[-] file_reader (expanded):
ðŸ”§ Tool Call: file_reader
Arguments: {"file_path": "example.txt"}
Result: File content here...
```

### Tool Call Duplication Fix (2025-01-03 13:26:30)
**ðŸ”§ FIXED**: Tool call duplication and timing issues resolved!

**Issue**: Tool calls were appearing twice and showing up after streamed messages instead of during streaming.

**Root Cause**: Tool calls were being processed in two places:
1. During the streaming loop (for real-time display)
2. After streaming completion (for conversation continuation)

This caused duplication and incorrect timing.

**Solution**: 
- Reverted to processing tool calls only after streaming completes
- Removed duplicate tool execution logic
- Tool calls now appear once, properly formatted, after the streaming content completes
- Maintained proper conversation flow for multi-turn interactions

**Result**: Clean, single tool call display with complete argument and result information.

### Tool Call Timing Fix (2025-01-03 13:33:56)
**ðŸŽ¯ ENHANCED**: Tool calls now appear immediately when LLM decides to use them!

**Enhancement**: Moved tool call detection and display to happen before text generation starts.

**Implementation**:
- **Real-time Detection**: Tool calls are detected and displayed as soon as they appear in the streaming response
- **Priority Processing**: Tool calls are processed before text chunks in each streaming chunk
- **Immediate Execution**: Tools execute immediately when detected, showing results in real-time
- **Deduplication**: Added tracking to prevent duplicate tool calls from being processed
- **Clean Architecture**: Simplified to single implementation using `ProcessMessageStreamWithMessageCallback`

**User Experience**:
- Tool calls appear instantly when the LLM decides to use them
- No waiting for text generation to complete before seeing tool execution
- Clear visual feedback with "Status: Executing..." followed by results
- Better understanding of agent's decision-making process

**Technical Flow**:
1. LLM response contains tool call â†’ Tool call displayed immediately
2. Tool executes â†’ Result shown in real-time  
3. Text generation begins â†’ Streaming text appears
4. Clean integration with conversation history for multi-turn interactions

This matches the behavior shown in the [official Gemini function calling examples](https://github.com/google-gemini/api-examples/blob/main/go/function_calling.go).

### Build Status
âœ… **Build Successful** - All compilation errors resolved, `go vet` passes
âœ… **Streaming Fixed** - Content now properly displays when streaming is enabled

### Technical Implementation Notes
- Used `iter.Seq2[*genai.GenerateContentResponse, error]` for Go 1.23 range-over-func support
- Implemented token counting using `genai.CountTokensConfig` and `CountTokens` API
- Streaming preserves conversation history and tool execution flow
- TUI maintains backward compatibility while adding new streaming features
