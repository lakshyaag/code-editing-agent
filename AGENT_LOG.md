## 2025-01-27: System Prompt Loading & Glob Tool Addition

### ðŸ“¦ IMPLEMENTED: Embedded System Prompt and File Globbing Tool

**Feature Request**: Load the contents of sys.md into constants and add a glob tool for file pattern matching.

**Implementation Details**:

#### 1. System Prompt Embedding
**Problem**: The `SystemPrompt` constant in `internal/config/constants.go` was empty and needed to load content from `sys.md`.

**Solution**: Used Go's embed feature to load sys.md at compile time:
```go
import _ "embed"

//go:embed ../../../sys.md
var SystemPrompt string
```

**Technical Changes**:
- Changed `SystemPrompt` from `const` to `var` to support embedding
- Added `//go:embed` directive to load sys.md content at compile time
- The path `../../../sys.md` is relative to the constants.go file location
- Content is automatically loaded when the binary is built

#### 2. Glob Tool Implementation
**Feature**: Added a new tool for finding files using glob patterns.

**Capabilities**:
- Simple patterns: `*.go`, `*.txt`, `*.json`
- Recursive patterns: `**/*.go`, `**/*.md`
- Custom base paths: Can search from specific directories
- Clean formatted output with file count and paths

**Technical Implementation**:
- Created `internal/tools/glob.go` with:
  - `GlobInput` struct for parameters
  - `GlobDefinition` following agent tool pattern
  - `Glob` function for execution
  - Support for both simple glob and recursive `**` patterns
- Registered in `internal/tools/tools.go` by adding `GlobDefinition`

**Key Features**:
- **Pattern Matching**: Standard glob patterns plus `**` for recursive search
- **Path Normalization**: Converts to relative paths for cleaner output
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid patterns
- **Formatted Output**: Shows match count and file list

**Usage Examples**:
```json
{"pattern": "*.go"}                    // All Go files in current directory
{"pattern": "**/*.md"}                 // All Markdown files recursively
{"pattern": "*.txt", "path": "docs"}   // Text files in docs directory
```

**Result**: System prompt now automatically loads from sys.md at compile time, and users have a powerful glob tool for file discovery.

**Build Status**: âœ… Compiles successfully, `go vet` passes

## 2025-01-03: UI Improvements - Tool View Background & Hotkey Enhancement

### ðŸŽ¨ ENHANCED: Tool View Background Colors & Ctrl+T Hotkey

**Issue**: Tool view background colors were not being applied consistently, and the `Ctrl+T` hotkey behavior was inconsistent.

**Problems Identified**:
1. **Inconsistent Background**: Tool call blocks had patches where the lighter background wasn't applied, especially in code blocks and markdown content
2. **Complex Renderer**: Custom `glamour` renderer with modified styles was causing conflicts and build issues
3. **Hotkey Logic**: `Ctrl+T` was inverting states rather than unifying them (toggle behavior was unpredictable)

**Solution - Simplified Styling Architecture**:
1. **Unified Renderer**: Removed custom tool renderer, now using single `markdownRenderer` for consistency
2. **Clean Background Application**: Background color applied once at the `lipgloss` level to entire tool block
3. **Predictable Hotkey**: `Ctrl+T` now checks if any tools are expanded â†’ if yes, collapse all; if none expanded, expand all

**Technical Changes**:
- **Removed Custom Components**: Deleted `internal/tui/markdown.go` and `toolRenderer` field
- **Simplified Styles**: Removed `toolRendererStyle` and `neutralStyle` from `styles.go`
- **Clean Rendering**: `renderToolMessage` now applies `toolBackgroundStyle` once to entire block
- **Fixed Hotkey Logic**: `Ctrl+T` now provides unified toggle behavior for all tool calls

**UI Improvements**:
- **Consistent Background**: Tool view now has uniform lighter background (color "237") throughout
- **Better Visual Separation**: Tool calls stand out clearly from main conversation
- **Reliable Controls**: `Ctrl+T` hotkey works predictably to show/hide all tool details
- **Cleaner Code**: Removed redundant styling and simplified rendering pipeline

**Result**: Tool view has consistent visual styling with proper background colors and reliable keyboard controls. The UI feels more polished and integrated.

**Build Status**: âœ… Compiles successfully, `go vet` passes

## 2025-01-03: Tool Message Override Fix + UI Cleanup

### ðŸŽ¯ FIXED: Tool messages no longer get overridden by streaming placeholder

**Issue**: Tool messages were appearing briefly but then getting visually overridden when the streaming message placeholder was created.

**Root Cause**: The streaming message placeholder was being created immediately when user pressed Enter, before knowing if there would be tool calls. This caused:
1. Streaming placeholder appears at end of message list
2. Tool messages get added after it
3. Visual ordering gets confusing as streaming updates

**Solution - Lazy Streaming Message Creation**:
1. **Removed Early Placeholder**: Don't create streaming message until we actually receive text chunks
2. **Tool Messages First**: Tool messages now appear cleanly before any streaming text
3. **Proper Order**: Tool calls â†’ streaming text, exactly as intended

**UI Cleanup**:
- **Removed "(streaming)" indicator**: Cleaner UI without redundant streaming labels
- **Simplified spinner text**: "Agent is thinking..." instead of "Agent is thinking and will stream response..."
- **Removed unused streamingStyle**: Cleaned up code by removing unused styling

**Technical Changes**:
- **TUI**: Moved streaming message creation from `tea.KeyEnter` to first `streamChunkMsg`
- **Ordering**: Tool messages appear first, then streaming message gets created when text starts
- **Cleanup**: Removed streaming indicators and simplified text

**Result**: Perfect flow where tool calls appear immediately and cleanly, followed by streaming response text. No more visual override issues.

**Build Status**: âœ… Compiles successfully, `go vet` passes

## 2025-01-03: Tool Message Timing Fix - Real-time Tool Display

### ðŸŽ¯ MAJOR ENHANCEMENT: Tool calls now appear immediately before streaming begins!

**Issue**: Tool messages were appearing at the end after streaming completed instead of before the AI's final response.

**User's Desired Flow**:
1. User sends message
2. Agent calls tool â†’ **Tool message appears immediately**
3. Tool executes and returns to agent
4. Agent starts providing final answer (streaming text)

**Root Cause**: Tool messages were being collected during streaming but only displayed after completion via the `streamCompleteMsg` handler.

**Solution - Real-time Tool Message Callbacks**:
1. **Added ToolMessageCallback**: New callback type in agent for immediate tool message delivery
2. **Modified ProcessMessage**: Added `toolCallback` parameter to send tool messages immediately when processed
3. **Enhanced TUI**: Added `toolMessageChan` and `toolMessageMsg` handler for real-time tool display
4. **Callback Architecture**: Tool messages now use callback pattern like text chunks for immediate delivery

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Agent**: `ProcessMessage` now accepts both `textCallback` and `toolCallback` parameters
- **TUI**: Added `waitForToolMessage` command and `toolMessageMsg` case handler  
- **Channels**: New `toolMessageChan` for real-time tool message communication
- **Flow**: Tool messages sent via callback â†’ displayed immediately â†’ text streaming begins

**Result**: Clean separation where tool calls appear instantly when the LLM decides to use them, followed by the streamed final response. This matches the flow shown in [advanced Go LLM applications](https://blog.gopenai.com/unlocking-the-power-of-golang-for-advanced-llm-applications-a-practical-guide-2e40de2ce00d) and provides better user experience.

**Build Status**: âœ… Compiles successfully, `go vet` passes

5. **Enhanced UX**: Visual indicators for streaming state and token usage
6. **Performance Optimization**: Pre-computed function declarations

### Latest Update (2025-01-03 13:19:14)
**ðŸš€ MAJOR FIX**: Real-time streaming fully implemented!

**Issue Identified**: Streaming was cutting off and messages were not appearing in real-time as the user expected.

**Root Cause**: The previous implementation accumulated all chunks and only displayed them at the end, which wasn't true streaming.

**Solution Applied - Complete Streaming Rewrite**:
1. **Real-time Architecture**: Implemented channel-based streaming with immediate chunk delivery
2. **Bubble Tea Integration**: Used proper command patterns (`waitForStreamChunk`, `waitForStreamComplete`) 
3. **Live Updates**: Each chunk now appears immediately in the UI as it arrives from the Gemini API
4. **Callback Integration**: Streaming callback sends chunks to UI channels for real-time display
5. **Concurrency**: Proper goroutine management for streaming without blocking the UI

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Channels**: `streamChunkChan` and `streamCompleteChan` for real-time communication
- **Commands**: Bubble Tea commands that listen for streaming chunks and completion
- **Callback**: Agent callback immediately sends chunks to UI via channels
- **Non-blocking**: Channel operations use `select` to avoid blocking the agent

This now provides smooth, real-time streaming like ChatGPT where text appears as it's generated!

### Tool Call Display Fix (2025-01-03 13:24:04)
**ðŸ”§ FIXED**: Tool call display issues resolved!

**Issues Fixed**:
1. **Real-time Tool Calls**: Tool calls now appear immediately during streaming instead of after completion
2. **No More Replacement**: Tool calls stay visible and don't get replaced by subsequent messages  
3. **Better Tool Info**: Collapsed tool calls now show the tool name instead of generic "Tool call"
4. **Complete Details**: Tool calls display both arguments and results when expanded

**Technical Changes**:
- **Agent Level**: Modified streaming to process tool calls immediately as they appear
- **Content Format**: Tool calls now include emoji, tool name, arguments, and result in structured format
- **TUI Rendering**: Enhanced tool message display with better collapsed/expanded states
- **Stream Processing**: Tool calls are processed during streaming, not just at completion

**Tool Call Format Now Shows**:
```
[+] file_reader (collapsed)
[-] file_reader (expanded):
ðŸ”§ Tool Call: file_reader
Arguments: {"file_path": "example.txt"}
Result: File content here...
```

### Tool Call Duplication Fix (2025-01-03 13:26:30)
**ðŸ”§ FIXED**: Tool call duplication and timing issues resolved!

**Issue**: Tool calls were appearing twice and showing up after streamed messages instead of during streaming.

**Root Cause**: Tool calls were being processed in two places:
1. During the streaming loop (for real-time display)
2. After streaming completion (for conversation continuation)

This caused duplication and incorrect timing.

**Solution**: 
- Reverted to processing tool calls only after streaming completes
- Removed duplicate tool execution logic
- Tool calls now appear once, properly formatted, after the streaming content completes
- Maintained proper conversation flow for multi-turn interactions

**Result**: Clean, single tool call display with complete argument and result information.

### Tool Call Timing Fix (2025-01-03 13:33:56)
**ðŸŽ¯ ENHANCED**: Tool calls now appear immediately when LLM decides to use them!

**Enhancement**: Moved tool call detection and display to happen before text generation starts.

**Implementation**:
- **Real-time Detection**: Tool calls are detected and displayed as soon as they appear in the streaming response
- **Priority Processing**: Tool calls are processed before text chunks in each streaming chunk
- **Immediate Execution**: Tools execute immediately when detected, showing results in real-time
- **Deduplication**: Added tracking to prevent duplicate tool calls from being processed
- **Clean Architecture**: Simplified to single implementation using `ProcessMessageStreamWithMessageCallback`

**User Experience**:
- Tool calls appear instantly when the LLM decides to use them
- No waiting for text generation to complete before seeing tool execution
- Clear visual feedback with "Status: Executing..." followed by results
- Better understanding of agent's decision-making process

**Technical Flow**:
1. LLM response contains tool call â†’ Tool call displayed immediately
2. Tool executes â†’ Result shown in real-time  
3. Text generation begins â†’ Streaming text appears
4. Clean integration with conversation history for multi-turn interactions

This matches the behavior shown in the [official Gemini function calling examples](https://github.com/google-gemini/api-examples/blob/main/go/function_calling.go).

### Build Status
âœ… **Build Successful** - All compilation errors resolved, `go vet` passes

## 2025-01-27: Thought Message Support - Displaying Gemini's Thinking Process

### ðŸ§  IMPLEMENTED: Real-time display of Gemini's thought messages

**Feature Request**: Display Gemini's thought messages (thinking process) in the TUI, similar to how tool messages are displayed.

**Context**: The debug.log showed that Gemini API returns thought messages with `"thought": true` field when thinking mode is enabled. These messages provide insight into the model's reasoning process.

**Solution - Thought Message Architecture**:
1. **Agent Level**: Added `ThoughtMessage` type and `ThoughtMessageCallback` for real-time delivery
2. **Streaming Handler**: Detect thought parts via `part.Thought` field and send immediately
3. **TUI Integration**: Display thoughts in collapsible blocks similar to tool messages
4. **Visual Design**: Gray color scheme (ðŸ’­) to distinguish from tools (ðŸ”§)
5. **Unified Controls**: Ctrl+T toggles both tools and thoughts together

**Technical Implementation**:

**Agent Package Changes**:
- Added `ThoughtMessage` to `MessageType` enum
- Added `ThoughtMessageCallback` type
- Updated `ProcessMessage` signature to accept `thoughtCallback` parameter
- Added thought detection: `if part.Thought && part.Text != ""`
- Format thoughts with ðŸ’­ emoji prefix

**TUI Package Changes**:
- Added `thoughtMessage` to messageType enum  
- Added `thoughtMessageMsg` and `thoughtMessageChan` for channel communication
- Implemented `waitForThoughtMessage` command pattern
- Added thought message handler in Update method
- Updated Ctrl+T to toggle both tools and thoughts

**Rendering Changes**:
- Added `renderThoughtMessage` function with collapsible UI
- Gray color scheme: header color "244", background color "236"
- Markdown rendering support for thought content
- Updated help text: "Ctrl+T: Tools/Thoughts"

**Key Features**:
- **Real-time Display**: Thoughts appear immediately during streaming
- **Collapsible UI**: Click to expand/collapse thought details
- **Unified Experience**: Same interaction pattern as tool messages
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Different colors help distinguish message types
- **Thinking Mode Integration**: Automatically enabled via `ThinkingConfig`

**Result**: Users can now see Gemini's reasoning process in real-time when thinking mode is enabled. The thoughts appear as collapsible gray blocks before the final response, providing transparency into the AI's decision-making process.

**Build Status**: âœ… Compiles successfully, `go vet` passes

## Debug Logging Issue

**Note**: The agent currently contains debug logging that writes JSON chunks to stdout (`log.Printf` in agent.go line 139). This interferes with the bubbletea TUI. When building TUI apps with bubbletea, you cannot log or print to the terminal - instead use Delve for debugging as noted in the memories.
